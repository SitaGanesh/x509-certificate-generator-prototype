# X.509 Certificate Generator Prototype

This is a prototype for my GSoC 2025 proposal to add X.509 Certificate Generator Templates to OpenWISP. It shows how users can create certificate templates and generate certificates with options like duration and key length. Below are instructions to set it up and run it locally.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have these installed:
- **Python 3.8 or higher** (check with `python --version` or `python3 --version`)
- **Git** (check with `git --version`)
- **pip** (Python package manager, usually comes with Python)

## Installation Steps
Follow these steps carefully to run the prototype on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   `git clone https://github.com/SitaGanesh/x509-certificate-generator-prototype.git`
